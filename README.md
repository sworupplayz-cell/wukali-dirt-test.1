# Horizon Ride

A lightweight, Android-first, 3D off-road dirt-bike game.

**Current status: Chapter 3D — Stability & optimization.** Engine polish
only. TERRAIN POPPING ELIMINATED: the tile grid grew a hidden PRE-BUILD
ring (11x11 tracked, 9x9 visible) — tiles entering view only flip
visible=true, they never build in sight (verified: 0 of 611 builds during
a 6.3 km ride happened inside the visible window). GLITCH FIXES: camera
near plane 0.1 -> 0.45 (recovers ~4.5x depth precision at km-scale far
planes — distant shimmer gone), far-terrain backdrop gets polygonOffset +
a deeper 2.2 m underlay (no z-fighting in the LOD overlap band), and the
shadow rig now SNAPS to shadow-texel-sized world increments so the shadow
field no longer shimmers while riding. CAMERA SMOOTHING (controls
untouched): follow height tracks a slow-smoothed bike altitude (suspension
bounce and micro-bumps no longer pump the view), the terrain-clearance
clamp is eased instead of snapping, and the look-at target uses the same
smoothed altitude — cinematic, still responsive on real drops. PERF: debug
bookkeeping throttled to 4 Hz (removed the frame loop's only recurring
allocations), F3 adds FRAME ms. The Chapter 3C quality system (5 presets,
instant apply, local save) carries over and is re-verified live.

## Tech

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering (only runtime dependency)
- Custom arcade heightfield physics (no physics engine — stable and cheap on low-end phones)
- Plain DOM/CSS for all UI (menu, pause, crash, touch HUD) — zero GPU cost, crisp at any DPI
- Vite for dev/build
- Runs in any Android browser; wrapped as an APK via Capacitor (`android/`)

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server
npm run build    # production build -> dist/
```

## Architecture

World (Phase 3 landforms on the Phase 2 foundation + Phase 1B streaming):

- `src/world/Landforms.js` — the authored continental skeleton: 4 ridge
  chains of named peaks with saddles, U/V valleys, flat-pan basins,
  escarpments, the summit plateau, and the FULL road hierarchy (main
  roads / pass switchbacks / spiral; grade-clamped by construction,
  junction-pinned, spatial-hash blended with bed-dominance weighting so
  junction handovers are seamless) plus road-computed scenic viewpoints.
- `src/world/Props.js` — instanced exploration props (7 InstancedMeshes):
  prayer flags, signposts, rocks, lookout platforms, cabins, caves,
  resting spots; deterministic per-sector placement, streamed with the
  sector window, solid props feed the bike's collider system.
- `src/world/TerrainField.js` — the analytic ground truth: height, trail
  mask, moisture and mountain factor as pure deterministic functions of
  world (x, z). Composes the Phase 2 rolling lowlands with the Phase 3
  landforms; lowland trails fade out at the foothills where pass roads
  take over.
- `src/world/FarTerrain.js` — static low-LOD continent backdrop: the whole
  world sampled once at 62.5 m into 4 frustum-culled meshes (~25 k tris);
  near-field fragments discarded under the streamed tiles.
- `src/world/palette.js` — shared vertex-color altitude palette
  (grass -> basin scrub -> alpine rock -> snow, roads always readable).
- `src/world/TerrainTiles.js` — render layer: pooled 125 m terrain tiles
  (7x7 window, 32x32 quads on an exact-binary global lattice) rebuilt
  nearest-first 2-3/frame. Shared vertex-colored Lambert material, no
  textures. Borders are bit-identical => zero seams, no skirts needed.
- `src/world/SectorWorld.js` — the fixed world facade: permanent 20x10
  sector grid (500 m sectors, IDs (0,0)..(19,9)), 3x3 logical sector window
  (gameplay content attaches here in later phases), world interface for the
  bike — `{ getHeight, getNormal, getColliders, getSurface,
  getRenderedPlane, getSpawn, isInBounds, update }` — plus `slopeAt` for
  the debug overlay. Spawn sits on a dirt trail near the world center.
- `src/world/streaming/ChunkGrid.js` — window bookkeeping with enter/leave
  deltas (drives both the sector and the tile windows).
- `src/world/streaming/ObjectPool.js` — fixed-capacity mesh pool
  (tile load/unload never allocates).
- `src/world/noise.js` — seeded hashing / value noise / fBM utilities.

Game core (preserved foundation):

- `src/bike/Bike.js` — arcade physics: ground/air states, suspension,
  surface grip/drag/roughness, wheelies/endos, flips, crash detection,
  safe-spot reset. Talks to the world only through the sampling interface.
- `src/bike/BikeModel.js` — low-poly bike + rider built from primitives,
  terrain-seated wheels, blob shadow (no shadow maps).
- `src/core/Game.js` — state machine (menu/playing/paused/crashed) +
  fixed-timestep loop.
- `src/core/Input.js` — keyboard + touch abstraction with selectable steering
  modes (buttons / handlebar / tilt / swipe).
- `src/core/FollowCamera.js` — smoothed third-person chase camera with
  terrain clearance + eased first-person POV.
- `src/core/Settings.js` — persisted control preferences + custom HUD layout.
- `src/core/RunStats.js` — run distance (teleport-guarded), persistent best.
- `src/core/StuntTracker.js` — trick detection/scoring/combos from bike state.
- `src/core/GameAudio.js` — synthesized engine + optional music (no assets).
- `src/ui/UI.js`, `src/ui/HudEditor.js` — DOM overlays + HUD layout editor.
- `src/ui/DebugOverlay.js` — developer overlay (F3 / DBG button): FPS,
  player X/Z, current sector, loaded sectors/tiles, terrain height, player
  altitude, slope, draw calls.

## Tests

```bash
bash tests/setup-browser.sh   # once per machine: headless-Chromium toolkit (to /tmp)
npm run test:e2e              # full foundation verification against the dev server
```
