# Horizon Ride

A lightweight, Android-first, 3D off-road dirt-bike game.

**Current status: Phase 3 — Major landforms.** The fixed 10,000 m x 5,000 m
world is now a believable continent: 18 unique named peaks connected into 4
ridge chains (Crown Range, Mistral Wall, Southern Teeth, Grey Spur — highest:
Rajadhara Summit ~4600 m), 14 saddles of which 12 carry switchback pass
roads, 6 U-shaped glacial troughs + 8 V-shaped gorges, 6 basins (lowest
~-100 m), 5 escarpments, and a 5-loop spiral road to the highest summit's
rideable plateau. All roads are grade-clamped by construction (max ~29%,
hairpins near-level) and laid by a contour-aware switchback walker at
startup — deterministic, no meshes, pure analytic field. A static far-LOD
continent backdrop (4 draw calls) makes the ranges visible for kilometres;
altitude palette bands (grass -> scrub -> rock -> snow) are shared between
near tiles and the backdrop. F3 shows elevation, slope %, and the peak
name/ID + range while on a massif.

## Tech

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering (only runtime dependency)
- Custom arcade heightfield physics (no physics engine — stable and cheap on low-end phones)
- Plain DOM/CSS for all UI (menu, pause, crash, touch HUD) — zero GPU cost, crisp at any DPI
- Vite for dev/build
- Runs in any Android browser; wrapped as an APK via Capacitor (`android/`)

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server
npm run build    # production build -> dist/
```

## Architecture

World (Phase 3 landforms on the Phase 2 foundation + Phase 1B streaming):

- `src/world/Landforms.js` — the authored continental skeleton: 4 ridge
  chains of named peaks with saddles, U/V valleys, basins, escarpments,
  the summit plateau, and all mountain roads (contour-aware switchback
  walker + spiral, grade-clamped, spatial-hash blended into the field).
- `src/world/TerrainField.js` — the analytic ground truth: height, trail
  mask, moisture and mountain factor as pure deterministic functions of
  world (x, z). Composes the Phase 2 rolling lowlands with the Phase 3
  landforms; lowland trails fade out at the foothills where pass roads
  take over.
- `src/world/FarTerrain.js` — static low-LOD continent backdrop: the whole
  world sampled once at 62.5 m into 4 frustum-culled meshes (~25 k tris);
  near-field fragments discarded under the streamed tiles.
- `src/world/palette.js` — shared vertex-color altitude palette
  (grass -> basin scrub -> alpine rock -> snow, roads always readable).
- `src/world/TerrainTiles.js` — render layer: pooled 125 m terrain tiles
  (7x7 window, 32x32 quads on an exact-binary global lattice) rebuilt
  nearest-first 2-3/frame. Shared vertex-colored Lambert material, no
  textures. Borders are bit-identical => zero seams, no skirts needed.
- `src/world/SectorWorld.js` — the fixed world facade: permanent 20x10
  sector grid (500 m sectors, IDs (0,0)..(19,9)), 3x3 logical sector window
  (gameplay content attaches here in later phases), world interface for the
  bike — `{ getHeight, getNormal, getColliders, getSurface,
  getRenderedPlane, getSpawn, isInBounds, update }` — plus `slopeAt` for
  the debug overlay. Spawn sits on a dirt trail near the world center.
- `src/world/streaming/ChunkGrid.js` — window bookkeeping with enter/leave
  deltas (drives both the sector and the tile windows).
- `src/world/streaming/ObjectPool.js` — fixed-capacity mesh pool
  (tile load/unload never allocates).
- `src/world/noise.js` — seeded hashing / value noise / fBM utilities.

Game core (preserved foundation):

- `src/bike/Bike.js` — arcade physics: ground/air states, suspension,
  surface grip/drag/roughness, wheelies/endos, flips, crash detection,
  safe-spot reset. Talks to the world only through the sampling interface.
- `src/bike/BikeModel.js` — low-poly bike + rider built from primitives,
  terrain-seated wheels, blob shadow (no shadow maps).
- `src/core/Game.js` — state machine (menu/playing/paused/crashed) +
  fixed-timestep loop.
- `src/core/Input.js` — keyboard + touch abstraction with selectable steering
  modes (buttons / handlebar / tilt / swipe).
- `src/core/FollowCamera.js` — smoothed third-person chase camera with
  terrain clearance + eased first-person POV.
- `src/core/Settings.js` — persisted control preferences + custom HUD layout.
- `src/core/RunStats.js` — run distance (teleport-guarded), persistent best.
- `src/core/StuntTracker.js` — trick detection/scoring/combos from bike state.
- `src/core/GameAudio.js` — synthesized engine + optional music (no assets).
- `src/ui/UI.js`, `src/ui/HudEditor.js` — DOM overlays + HUD layout editor.
- `src/ui/DebugOverlay.js` — developer overlay (F3 / DBG button): FPS,
  player X/Z, current sector, loaded sectors/tiles, terrain height, player
  altitude, slope, draw calls.

## Tests

```bash
bash tests/setup-browser.sh   # once per machine: headless-Chromium toolkit (to /tmp)
npm run test:e2e              # full foundation verification against the dev server
```
